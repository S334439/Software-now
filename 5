#use UP/DOWN INPUTS together to find vertical distance

#use RIGHT/LEFT to find horizontal

#this will even give a grid and directions, with added maths

U, D, R, L = 0, 0, 0, 0 #Define starting points (0,0) as given in question

#add each given input from question, when car is running these would be input from GPS data or some other oracle

#create variables for vertical and horizontal distance, i chose same polaritys as a standard xy plane

vertical = U - D      #print(vertical) test only   =2

horizontal = R - L    #print(horizontal) test only   =-1

#now we know pythagoras is  c^2 = a^2 + b^2     c^2 = 2^2 + -1^2 = 5

distancesquared = (vertical * vertical) + (horizontal * horizontal)     #c^2 = 2^2 + -1^2 = 5

#we can easily set up code for direction as well. example below. 

#if vertical > 0, north
#if horizotal > 0, east
#if vertical < 0, south
#if horizontal < 0, west
#if horizontal and vertical == 0, you are home
